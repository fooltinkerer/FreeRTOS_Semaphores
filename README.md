# Development of Real-Time Systems: Assignment 1 - Semaphores
---

The present code is based on the FreeRTOS Posix_GCC example for Linux. The main part - the examples - is in `main_semaphores.c` whose function, `void main_semaphores( void )`, is called from `int main( void )`.

To compile the SW, under linux, type `make posix_demo`. The program can be launched by typing `./build/posix_demo` 

Important note: the code needs to be located under `FreeRTOS/Demo/Posix_GCC. As a result, you should first download the FreeRTOS code (the code is under https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS - clone it from there and save the present repository - 'https://github.com/fooltinkerer/FreeRTOS_Semaphores' - under the Demo folder)
