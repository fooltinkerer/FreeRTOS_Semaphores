# Development of Real-Time Systems: Assignment 1
---

The present code is based on the FreeRTOS Posix_GCC example for Linux. The main part is in `main_semaphores.c` whose function, `void main_semaphores( void )`, is called from `int main( void )`.

To compile the SW, under linux, type `make posix_demo`. The program can be launched by typing `./build/posix_demo` (note: the code is located under `FreeRTOS/Demo/Posix_GCC`)
